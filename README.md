# MathJax loader for Thunderbird

This plugin loads MathJax in the message pane, which renders any LaTeX in the message.
I find that to be useful for many of my RSS feeds, which regularly contain mathematics.

## How to use

1. Run `npm install`
2. Package `node_modules/`, `src/` and `manifest.json` into `MathJax-Thunderbird.zip`
3. Install `MathJax-Thunderbird.zip` as a file-based Thunderbird extension.
